This is a Read Me file for my first Challenge Module for the coding bootcamp.

The page associated with this READ ME is a webpage for a company named Horiseon and their services they can provide, such as:

Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing

Here is a link to my repository of the challenge: https://github.com/AJRies/semantic-html
